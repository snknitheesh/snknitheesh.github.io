        <h1>FTC Rover Ruckus Challenge</h1>
        <div class="timeline">
            <p><strong>Jan 2019 - Jul 2019</strong></p>
            <p>This project was accomplished during my undergraduate at PSG College of Technology.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>In the <strong>FTC Rover Ruckus Challenge</strong>, I was part of a robotics team that designed, programmed, and operated a robot to compete in a fast-paced, multi-phase robotics competition. The challenge included the <strong>Autonomous Period</strong>, <strong>Driver-Controlled Period</strong>, and <strong>Endgame</strong>, requiring innovative engineering and strategic gameplay.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Key Phases of the Competition</h2>
            <h3>Autonomous Period</h3>
            <p>Our robot successfully performed tasks such as landing, identifying and knocking over the gold mineral, placing a team marker in the depot, and parking on the crater, achieving the maximum possible points.</p>

            <h3>Driver-Controlled Period</h3>
            <p>We excelled in collecting and sorting minerals, ensuring the gold and silver minerals were deposited in their respective locations. Our efficient and precise robot design allowed us to outperform the competition.</p>

            <h3>Endgame</h3>
            <p>We showcased our robot's advanced capabilities by latching back onto the lander and parking inside the crater, maximizing our score in the final seconds of the match.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <p>We utilized a <strong>BeagleBone</strong> as the main hardware platform and developed the control logic using <strong>Python</strong>. For wireless communication, we implemented a <strong>ZigBee</strong> module, enabling seamless control and coordination during the competition.</p>
        </div>
        

        <p>This project honed my skills in programming, mechanical design, teamwork, and strategic thinking, further solidifying my passion for robotics and innovation.</p>
