            <h2><a href="nvidia_jetson_vision.html">Object Detetcion and Motion Detection</a></h2>
            <p>I recently worked on a project where I combined the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and the Intel Corporation RealSense D457 depth camera to develop a machine vision application. This setup allowed me to perform basic object detection, motion tracking, and use point cloud data, unlocking huge possibilities for real-world applications!</p>

            <p>I'm thrilled to share my latest project, where I've programmed the Pololu Corporation Pololu 3pi+ robot using the Arduino IDE to simulate a disaster management scenario. The robot's mission is to locate magnets, which represent injured individuals, and follow a predefined workflow to indicate their positions.</p>

            <p><strong>Jan 2019 - Jul 2019</strong></p>
            <p>Associated with PSG College of Technology</p>
            <p>This event is conducted by Caterpillar and Qualcomm. As a team, we created a Rover ruckus which was used for a space exploration theme. We had to collect samples from the moon using this rover resembling a pick and place application. My team won 2 awards: Overall Champion Award and Winning Alliance Award.</p>
